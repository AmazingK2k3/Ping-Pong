## Ping-Pong
A tribute to the all time classic Ping Pong/Ice hockey game of the 90's.
This project is a single player game against a computer. The Opponent computer is made using Javascript which follows a simple idea to trace the ball's path and hit it. 
The ball is coded in a way that it never leaves the game grid.
